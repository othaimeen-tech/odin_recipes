    <p>A hamburger, also called a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually
         a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll. </p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Tomatoe</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Salad</li>
            <li>Cucumber</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Meat</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Ground Beef: Select high-quality ground beef with a good fat content
                 (around 80% lean, 20% fat is often recommended for juiciness).</li>
            <li>Buns: Choose fresh burger buns. Brioche buns are popular for their
                 slightly sweet flavor and soft texture.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Optional, but commonly used. Cheddar, American,
                 or Swiss cheese are popular choices.</li>
            <li>Vegetables: Lettuce, tomato slices, onions (raw or caramelized),
                 and pickles are common toppings.</li>
            <li>Condiments: Ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, barbecue sauce, or other
                 preferred sauces.
            </li>
            <li>Cook the patties for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium doneness
                 (adjust cooking time based on your preference for doneness).</li>
            <li>Serve immediately while the burger is warm and the cheese is melted.</li>
         </ol>
